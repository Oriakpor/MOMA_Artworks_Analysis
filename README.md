### MOMA_Artworks_Analysis
This research dataset contains 157,630 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in their database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not Curator Approved.”

### Projectives
The objectives are to:
- How modern are the artworks at the MOMA?
- Which artists are featured most prominently?
- Are there any trends in the dates of acquisition?
- What types of artwork are most common?

### Data Source
The The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection data was obtained from Maven Analytics:
- https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

### Tools Employed
•	Python

### Results
1. The Arts classified are in the following percentage according to their ages:
- Mid-Century Arts = 35.1%
- Modern Arts = 34.2%
- Early 20th Century Arts= 25%
- 19th Century/Earlier Arts= 4.9%
- Contemporary Arts = 0.8%

2. The Artists mostly featured as shown are:
- Eugène Atget (5018)
- Marc Chagall (1035)
- Henri Matisse (796), etc

3. From the analysis, we observed the following trends in dates of data acquisition:
- A steady increase in acquisitions from the 1920s through the 1950s, showing a growing emphasis on collecting artworks over time.
- A significant spike in the number of acquisitions with the count exceeding 40,000 in the 1960s. This could be a period of increased activity in acquiring artworks, possibly due to cultural, economic, an outlier, or other factors.
- Also a huge decline in the acquisition of arts after the peak in the 1960s, but soon stabilized afterwards in the 1970s through 1990s.
- A surge in the acquisition in 2000-2010, and this could be as a result of renewed interest in arts or improved capacity to do so by musuems.
- A decline in 2020s, and this could be as a result of covid-19 pandemic, global recession, and massive decline in economic activities.

4. The type of Artworks most common are:
- Illustrated Book, Photograph, Design, Drawing, Architecture, etc

### Recommendations
- Since Mid-Century Arts (35.1%) and Modern Arts (34.2%) dominate the collection, museums should prioritize curating exhibitions and educational programs centered on these periods to cater to audience interests. Also, Invest in underrepresented categories like Contemporary Arts (0.8%) to diversify the collection and appeal to younger or contemporary art enthusiasts.
- With Eugène Atget, Marc Chagall, and Henri Matisse being the most featured artists, museums can organize thematic exhibitions or retrospectives to showcase their contributions.
- The significant spike in acquisitions during the 1960s could be explored as a historical case study. Analyze what led to this surge and replicate such strategies in modern contexts. Also, the surge in acquisitions from 2000 to 2010 suggests a successful renewal strategy. Museums could revisit and adapt policies from this period to reignite acquisitions post-pandemic.
- Partner with emerging artists and global art institutions to bring fresh perspectives into the collection.
- Develop international collaborations to acquire more contemporary and culturally diverse pieces.
- Lastly, Continuously analyze acquisition data to understand shifts in public interest and adapt collection strategies accordingly.
