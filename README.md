3. From the analysis, we observed the following trends in dates of data acquisition:
- A steady increase in acquisitions from the 1920s through the 1950s, showing a growing emphasis on collecting artworks over time.
- A significant spike in the number of acquisitions with the count exceeding 40,000 in the 1960s. This could be a period of increased activity in acquiring artworks, possibly due to cultural, economic, an outlier, or other factors.
- Also a huge decline in the acquisition of arts after the peak in the 1960s, but soon stabilized afterwards in the 1970s through 1990s.
- A surge in the acquisition in 2000-2010, and this could be as a result of renewed interest in arts or improved capacity to do so by musuems.
- A decline in 2020s, and this could be as a result of covid-19 pandemic, global recession, and massive decline in economic activities.

4. The type of Artworks most common are:
